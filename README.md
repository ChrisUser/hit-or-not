# Hit or not

Hit or not is a mini game in which two songs are displayed each time and you can choose your favourite one.
At the end the most voted hit is shown to the player.

The main scripts of the game are all in the `src\app\card-container\card-container.component.ts` file.

You can customize the game by changing the Spotify's urls for the songs in the `src\assets\data\songs.json` file.

## üöÄ Development server

To run a development server type the code below then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
